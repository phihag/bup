This document explains common data structures in bup and related projects. * denotes a required key. Types start with a Capital letter.

Event is the root data structure for the whole state, but these structures are also used in other contexts.



Event
=====

                gender key required for each player.
backup_players  2-element list (home/away), each element is another list of Player that can substitute on injury.
                gender key required for each player. These players can fill in in case of injury.
present_players 2-element list (home/away), each element is another list of Player.
                gender key required for each player. These players are present in the hall (e.g. injured, coaching).

                Each element is a dictionary with the keys "m" and "f".
